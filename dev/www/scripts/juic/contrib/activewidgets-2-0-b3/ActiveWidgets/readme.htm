    <h2>2.0 Beta 3</h2>

    <p>
		The beta3 fixes several bugs compared to beta2 (see <a href="http://www.activewidgets.com/javascript.forum.9240.0/2-0-beta3-change-log.html">change log</a>). Unfortunately the cell editing code has to be re-worked and therefore postponed to beta4, see the forum thread on this topic: <a href="http://www.activewidgets.com/javascript.forum.9201.14/please-comment-cell-editing-changing.html">/javascript.forum.9201.14/please-comment-cell-editing-changing.html</a></p>

    <h2>What's new</h2>

    <p>
        ActiveWidgets is no longer just grid control. There are several other components in the package which can be useful for building true client-side javascript applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are simple demo pages showing most of the additional controls:
    </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			XP look: <a href="examples/skins/controls-xp-quirks.htm">quirks</a>, <a href="examples/skins/controls-xp-strict.htm">strict</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Aqua: <a href="examples/skins/controls-aqua-quirks.htm">quirks</a>, <a href="examples/skins/controls-aqua-strict.htm">strict</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Classic: <a href="examples/skins/controls-classic-quirks.htm">quirks</a>, <a href="examples/skins/controls-classic-strict.htm">strict</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Mono: <a href="examples/skins/controls-mono-quirks.htm">quirks</a>, <a href="examples/skins/controls-mono-strict.htm">strict</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="examples/new/dialog.htm">Typical dialog box example</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
    <p>
        However the main part of ActiveWidgets 2.0 is still grid control. With so many enhancements that we decided to split it in two :-) The library now includes two classes: AW.UI.Grid (simple grid) and AW.Grid.Extended (full set of features).
    </p>
    <p>
        The new grid supports 'virtual' rendering mode. In this mode only the visible part of the grid is populated with data which brings very significant increase in performance for large datasets. In fact with the new grid you can easily display datasets of 1000-10000 rows and the rendering speed does not depend on the size of the dataset.
    </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="examples/new/virtual.htm">Virtual mode demo (1000 rows)</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
    <p>
        The new grid also allows multiple fixed columns, headers, footers, editable cells and has a lot of API enhancements. Look at the source code of examples in <a href="examples/quickref/"><i>quickref</i></a> directory and try un-comment some lines to check the new features.
    </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="examples/quickref/grid.htm">Grid - quick reference (see source code)</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
        The event subsystem was significantly enhanced in the new grid and the whole grid operation is now based on the events which you can use to customize grid behavior if necessary.
    </p>


    <h2>Where to start</h2>

    <p>
        Have a look inside <a href="examples/quickref/">/examples/quickref/</a> folder. Hopefully this will give you an idea what the new API is. We believe that the new one is much more simple and consistent and could justify the migration headache. In the <a href="examples/old/">/examples/old/</a> folder you will find several files from 1.0 release converted to the new API so you can compare the new and old code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reference documentation and tutorial/examples will be added during the next weeks to the <a href="http://www.activewidgets.com/general.faq.releases/2-0.html">ActiveWidgets website</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
        Just copy <i>/runtime</i> folder to your webserver.
    </p>

    <h2>Debugging and Source Code</h2>

    <p>
        ActiveWidgets library is provided both in compressed format
        (<i>/runtime</i> folder) and in full source code form (<i>/source</i> folder).
    <p>
    </p>
        You can use full source version for debugging your code - change references
        to aw.js and aw.css files from <i>/runtime</i> to <i>/source</i> folder.
    </p>

    <h2>Community Support</h2>

    <p>
        The best place to find more information about the grid library is ActiveWidgets
        <a href="http://www.activewidgets.com/messages/">support forum</a>. You may
        find that someone already had a similar problem and found a solution and
        we would be very grateful if you share your own experience with us and other
        developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you so much and we hope that this product can do something good for you.
